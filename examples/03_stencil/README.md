# Optimized 2D stencil code series

This example section takes you through an approach to write a serial stencil
and scale it to an optimized distributed 2D stencil.

To be able to build this directory, you are required to have
[HPX](https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx) and
[NSIMD](https://github.com/agenium-scale/nsimd) installed.
